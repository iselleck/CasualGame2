# Space Friends

Replace your real friends with SPACEFRIENDS.

A game about using slight visual cues and a slow, measured pacing - based in a hypothetical space physics simulation - to guide an astral visitor through an asteroid field where they might encounter some unusual oddities, and possibly find something to play with. Intended to be played slowly and with headphones, for best effect. 

WASD to move 
R/F to ascend/descend
LMB to shoot
